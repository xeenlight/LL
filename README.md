# Project Overview

This application was created as part of the **Meta Front-End Developer Certification**.

**Project Description**: The application serves Little Lemon, a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that offers a fusion of traditional and contemporary dishes. The restaurant strives to deliver a memorable dining experience, guiding customers through a distinctive culinary journey.

**Purpose**: The project aimed to develop a modern, responsive front-end for the Little Lemon website. It includes an essential booking feature that was previously missing from the site.

# Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jayantasamaddar/little-lemon-meta-frontend-capstone.git project-folder

# Install required dependencies
npm install

# Launch the app in the browser
npm start

# Run the unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with code coverage
npm test:cv
```

# Front-End Architecture

The front-end was built with several key design principles in mind:

1. **Folder Structure** - Ensuring files are organized in a logical and clean way within the `src` directory.
2. **Component Design** - Creating reusable components to maintain consistency across the application.
3. **Naming Conventions** - Using clear and descriptive naming for both components and styles.
4. **External Dependencies** - Choosing minimal dependencies to keep the project lightweight.
5. **Data Handling** - Managing and fetching the necessary data for the application.
6. **Unit Testing** - Ensuring robust test coverage for all components and pages.

---

## Naming Conventions

To keep the codebase organized and easy to navigate, the following naming conventions were adopted:

- **CSS Classes**: Component-specific classes use the prefix `LL-Component`. For nested elements, PascalCase is used (e.g., `LL-ComponentSubComponent`).
- **Utility Classes**: Global utility classes like `text-sm`, `text-m`, and `text-xl` were defined for consistent font sizes across the app.
- **CSS Variables**: Global variables were created for design consistency, such as `box-shadow-1`, `box-shadow-2`, etc.

---

## External Dependencies

The project was designed to minimize external dependencies, focusing on core React and JavaScript features:

- Custom styles were written from scratch, without relying on external CSS frameworks.
- Custom validation functions were implemented instead of using libraries like Formik or Yup (e.g., `validateNumber`).
- Font Awesome was added for iconography.

---

## Data Handling

For handling data fetching, especially for commonly used items such as header and footer links, a mock CMS was used instead of a real database. This mock CMS data is stored in the `settings/cms` directory, allowing for easy data manipulation and scalability.

---

## Unit Testing

Testing was implemented using React Testing Library, Jest, and Jestdom, all integrated into `create-react-app`:

- The `setupTests.js` file was configured to support interaction with the global window object.
- Mocks were created for React hooks like `useContext`, `useLocation`, and `useReducer` to ensure complete test coverage for components and pages.
